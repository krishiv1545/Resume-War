Mira Flows SDK is a powerful Python toolkit that enables developers to programmatically create, manage, and deploy AI-powered flows. Here, we're using one such custom built flow meant to analyse a JSONified resume and return remarks, reccomendations and most importantly, scores.
The score is parsed and stored within the Leaderboard thus allowing user to understand their strengths and shortcomings. 
Users can choose to preview reviews of people ranked above them to understand what next steps are to be taken to grow and learn beyond!

To run this repository, you will require "MIRA_API_KEY". Head along to https://flows.mira.network and put it in your .env file (as shown in .env.example).
